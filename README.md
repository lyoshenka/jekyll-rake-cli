# Jekyll CLI via Rake

A Rakefile for Jekyll which provides a full CLI for creating posts, editing, tagging, etc.

# Install

- Copy `cli.rake` into your Jekyll directory.
- Add the required gems (`chronic`, `colorize`) to your Gemfile if they aren't there already.
- Add `import "cli.rake"` to your Rakefile. If you don't have a Rakefile, create an empty one.
